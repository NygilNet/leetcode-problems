You may perform the following move any number of times:

Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.

Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.
